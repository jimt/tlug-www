Welcome to the Tokyo Linux Users Group meetings page. Here you'll find information about our regular technical meetings featuring presentations on Linux, open source software, and related technologies, as well as our social gatherings (nomikai) where members can network and relax.

## Meeting Types

**Technical Meetings** - Monthly presentations covering a wide range of Linux and open source topics, from system administration and development to emerging technologies. These meetings typically feature 1-2 presentations followed by Q&A and general discussion.

**Nomikai (Social Meetings)** - Informal gatherings at restaurants or bars where members can socialize, network, and enjoy casual conversations about technology and life in Tokyo.

## Getting Involved

All TLUG meetings are free and open to the public. Whether you're a seasoned Linux expert or just getting started, you're welcome to join us. Most presentations are in English, but discussions can be in either English or Japanese.
