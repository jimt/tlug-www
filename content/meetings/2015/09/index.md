<h6 id="coroutines_by_benjamin_kowarsch">Coroutines (by <font color="#CC2200">Benjamin Kowarsch</font>)</h6>
<p>Coroutines are a multi-threading model that is a highly scalable
alternative to preemptive threads. There is an interesting paper called
“Revisiting Coroutines” by De Moura and Ierusalimschy of the Polytechnic
University of Rio de Janeiro, and of Lua fame.</p>
<p>This paper was the basis to redesign coroutines in Modula-2.
Benjamin will show how coroutines differ from preemptive threads and
what kind of support there is in different languages.</p>
<h6 id="postgresql_9.4_9.5_and_beyond_by_satoshi_nagayasu">PostgreSQL 9.4, 9.5 and Beyond (by <font color="#CC2200">Satoshi Nagayasu</font>)</h6>
<p>Recently, PostgreSQL has succeeded in getting popularity among web
developers. In this talk, Satoshi will introduce the new features in
the latest release 9.4 (JSON, Analytics, Logical Decoding, etc.) to
take advantages of the latest PostgreSQL advancement, and share a
quick look in the upcoming release 9.5. And he will also introduce
his personal projects around PostgreSQL.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
