<h5 id="presentations">Presentations</h5>
<h6 id="an_exploration_of_recursive_descent_parsing_by_benjamin_kowarsch">An Exploration of Recursive Descent Parsing (by <font color="#CC2200">Benjamin Kowarsch</font>)</h6>
<p>This presentation will give a general overview of common parsing
techniques and examine RD parsing in further detail. In particular it
will show how to design, visualise and troubleshoot grammars suitable
for RD parsing and how to transform such grammars into handwritten
RD parsers. It will also give a brief overview how to use ANTLRworks
for grammar evaluation and troubleshooting. Finally it will introduce
an unnamed free open source script that generates publishing quality syntax diagrams.</p>
<h6 id="x_com_and_its_open_source_remakes_by_andreas_kieckens">X-COM and its open source remakes (by <font color="#CC2200">Andreas Kieckens</font>)</h6>
<p>X-COM is an old DOS game that combines world-wide strategy with small squad
turn-based tactics. It is not *too* famous, but people who've played it
(including the presenter) often praise it as one of the best games ever made.
Over the years, a lot of game developers have attempted to recreate its magic.
Several of these projects are open source and even more can run on Linux.
This presentation will give an overview and show some of these games in action.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
