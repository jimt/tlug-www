<h4 id="itinerary">Itinerary</h4>
<h5 id="presentations">Presentations</h5>
<h6 id="androids_security_architecture_by_nikolay_elenkov">Android's Security Architecture (by <font color="#CC2200">Nikolay Elenkov</font>)</h6>
<p>This talk will give an overview of Android's security architecture from
the bottom up, and present the major Android subsystems and components
that relate to device and data security. The talk will cover broader
topics that affect all applications, such as package and user management,
permissions and device policy, and will also touch on more specific ones
such as cryptographic providers, PKI, and credential storage. Some of the
changes introduced in the new Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) release will also
be explored.</p>
<h6 id="deduplicating_backup_schemes_by_jim_tittsler">Deduplicating Backup Schemes (by <font color="#CC2200">Jim Tittsler</font>)</h6>
<p>Attic/Borg and Restic are examples of modern backup programs that provide
encryption, compression, and data integrity checks that are space efficient
even for massive files like virtual machine images. And there are convenience
features like mounting your backups as filesystems. Perhaps it is time to
replace those old rsnapshot, rdiff-backup and duplicity scripts.</p>
<h6 id="wakame_vdc_on_arch_linux_by_andreas_kieckens">Wakame-vdc on Arch Linux (by <font color="#CC2200">Andreas Kieckens</font>)</h6>
<p>Wakame-vdc is an open source data centre virtualization suite that
Andreas (and his colleagues) gets paid to develop. Though it officially
only supports Centos, Andreas has been working on some scripts to get it
up and running from scratch on Arch Linux using LXC and KVM.</p>
<p>During the presentation Andreas will briefly talk about what Wakame-vdc
is, explain what the scripts do to set it up and talk about how he plans
to use it to manage his multiple development and test environments
Full disclosure: The scripts are still in development and just how much
will actually work during the presentation is going to be a surprise. :p</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
