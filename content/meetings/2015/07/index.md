<h6 id="getting_started_with_raspberry_pi_2_by_masafumi_ohta">Getting Started with Raspberry Pi 2 (by <font color="#CC2200">Masafumi Ohta</font>)</h6>
<p>Ohta-san will recap the presentation he delivered at LinuxCon Japan 2015.
He will speak about 'why RPi2 was suddenly released' with insights he
gained in his trip to the UK, where he met Eben Upton at the Pi-Tower
in Cambridge.</p>
<p>He will also talk about some of the new OSes working on RPi 2 (Window IoT
and others), and give answers to questions he was asked by Linaro and
SUSE staff at LinuxCon.</p>
<h6 id="full_network_virtualization_with_openvnet_0.7_by_andreas_kieckens">Full network virtualization with OpenVNet 0.7 (by <font color="#CC2200">Andreas Kieckens</font>)</h6>
<p>After two years of development, Andreas and his colleagues have released
OpenVNet 0.7 which allows you to fully virtualize networks using
OpenFlow. During this presentation he will explain what exactly network
virtualization is, how OpenVNet achieves it and what some of its use
cases could be. To top it off he will show a live demo where OpenVNet is
used to join two cloud systems (Amazon EC2 and Wakame-vdc) together in a
single network. <a href="http://openvnet.org">http://openvnet.org</a></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
