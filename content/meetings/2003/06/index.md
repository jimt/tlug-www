			<p>June Technical Meeting features:  </p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Masanori "Smiley" Omote</b><br>
				<b>UML (User Mode Linux)</b><br>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			User Mode Linux is fun: a Linux kernel runs as a normal user process
			and it really works as a virtual Linux machine.  UML can be used as a
			web hosting tool which enables customers to get root privileges.  It
			also works as an experimental environment for safe networking.  It
			provides a test bed to help you to try another distribution safely.
			</p>
			<p>
			In this talk Omote demonstrates UML on an single subnote (VAIO C1;
			TM5600@667MHz + 240MB) and introduce it briefly. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Ricky Ng-Adam</b><br>
				<b>RSYNC</b><br>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Need to synchronize large quantities of files? rsync is the tool to do
			it! An explanation of the capabilities of that tool will be given
			followed by demonstrations and example of usage in conjunction with
			shell scripting and other Linux capabilities (such as local loopback
			files for backup).
			</p>
			<p>
			rsync is a file transfer program for Unix systems. rsync uses the 
			"rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast method for bringing 
			remote files into sync. It does this by sending just the differences 
			in the files across the link, without requiring that both sets of 
			files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.
