					<li>Spam Prevention: Attend if you run your own Linux mail server!</li>

					<a href="http://SpamBayes.SourceForge.net/">SpamBayes</a>

					<p>This year, we're looking to elect new president who can
					serve the wonderful Tokyo Linux user community for the year
					2003.</p>
					
					<p>President's job includes organizing technical meetings,
					(i.e., finding a meeting hall and speakers) set the general
					direction for the group, boss around the other officers (just
					kidding!) and promote the use of linux through technical
					meetings and drinking parties.</p>

					<p>Election Result:</p>

					<li>Auction</li>
					
					<p>
					Thanks to the illegally parked Ulrich Plate, we had a
					successful auction of the remnants of the Jonathan Byrne Legacy
					Collection.  People donated a total of Y6100 to TLUG.
					</p>
					<p>
					Thanks again to Ulrich for bringing along the items for
					auction... and then auctioning them off.  And to everyone
					for participating and donating to the group.
					</p>
					
					<li>Project at OSDL Japan</li>

					<p>OSDL (Open Source Development Lab) currently hosts TLUG's server
					free of charge in their Yokohama datacentre, on the condition 
					that TLUG proposes a Linux-based project with them, for which 
					they will provide development environment. This is a great way to 
					contribute to the open source community. 
					</p>

					<p>If you have any suggestions, please bring them here for us to 
					discuss and participate in. 
					</p>
