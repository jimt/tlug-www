The April 11th meeting brought together over 65 Linux enthusiasts in Tokyo,
including <B>Tague Griffith</B> of Netscape Communication's I18N division and
<B>Cliff Miller</B>, President of Pacific HiTech.
<P>
We first met at 12:30 at the Yaesu Chuo ticket gate and then
went to HSBC for Domino's pizza.  The total pizza bill was divided
up among all those that ate.    
<P>
<B>Joe Marchak</B>, <B>Ken Harada</B>, and <B>Craig Oda</B>, (three of the infamous 
gang of five TLUG officers) hopped up and down in front
of the meeting room to kick off this grand event.  Ken gave an
amazingly good simultaneous translation session.  The bilingual
meeting was an enormous success.  
<P>
Joe Marchak made an announcement that HSBC, and therefore the
June TLUG meeting, is moving to a new building on the same street.
<P>
The big things people were there for were Pizza, Linux, and Linux-Netscape.
<B>Shigeo Honda </B>led a genki task-force to collate and order the proper
number of pizzas.  This came out to 1,000 yen per person.  Shigeo
volunteered to be the TLUG Snackmaster for the next meeting.  We're
discussing ways to integrate this position into the core TLUG direction
setting team. 
<P>
<H2><U>Netscape</U></H2>
Tague Griffith gave a tremendous talk to a full house of people.
Some things Craig picked up:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   UI with motif, lesstif, and GTk at a minimum.  Regardless of the
     religious feelings on UI, these three would happen at a minimum.
<P>
   mozilla.org is a seperate group from Netscape.  It is intended that
   Netscape become another Mozilla distribution, in the same way that
   RedHat is another Linux distribution.  The mozilla.org group is
   intended to function as the benevolent dictator that Linus works
   as for the Linux kernel.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Tague gave out three source code CDs and dozens of Netscape pens.
<P>
The slides of the talk are in the TLUG library.  Tague has
released the slides on the net at

The meeting room was hot, filled with computers and people.  Joe and Craig
stopped counting after we found out that over 65 TLUG members were jammed
into the meeting room in the basement of HSBC.   There was a large
showing of JLUG people including <B>Daisuke Sato</B> (densuke@@ga2.so-net.ne.jp), 
core member of the
jrpm project, and <B>Chikasaka-san</B> (chisaka@@upu.co.jp), both of who 
agreed to help setup the TLUG server, though both had had a little to drink
at the time they agreed to do the work.   These two lads also
gave a nice demonstration of the Japanese input using the GTk graphical
widget set.  Craig immediately went home and compiled it with the
following:
<P>
cow:~/apps/gtk+-0.99.10$ ./configure  --enable-xim --with-locale=ja_JP
--host=i586-linux-gnu
<P>
Chikasaka-san is also going to tell Craig how to patch the majordomo
digest to have it support Japanese subject lines.  :-)
<P>
The <B>Metzler brothers</B> showed their video driver.  
<P>
jrpm now has a binary distribution of the Xlib with proper locale support.
<P>

The server is now accessible at:

<P>
We are still trying to register the tlug.gr.jp setsuzoku jyouhou with JPNIC.
<P>
We plan to offer e-mail, web page and extended mailing list services to the
membership in the near future.

into Japanese and seek publication from a professional publisher.

The current plan is to finish the online version and then make a 
proposal to O'Reilly Japan. 
<P>

<H2><U>Applixware-J</U></H2>
<P>
Applixware Japanese is out in Beta and is functional.  Cliff Miller,
president of Pacific HiTech, developers of TurboLinux, distributed
three copies of Applixware-J beta for testing.  If you received
a beta test copy, please send in a beta tester report.  
<P>
There was a nice demonstration of Applixware-J.  Pacific HiTech is 
going to distribute it for 29,800 yen at the end of May.  The
first release will not come with any import or export filters, so 
it will not be able to read and write Microsoft Office files.  However,
they are working on the filters needed to do this in the future.

<H2><U>JLUG</U></H2>
We're proposing a minimum of 10,000 yen donation to JLUG using money
collected at the meeting.  The first round of money goes toward the
purchase of a SCSI disk for the TLUG server.  Left over money is
being sent to JLUG.

<P>
One goal, two languages, this might be the simple explanation why
TLUG is seperate and independent from JLUG.  In order to facilitate
cooperation, we have formed the jtlug, where English or Japanese
are appropriate.

<H2><U>Clarification of TLUG</U></H2>

TLUG is totally independent of JLUG and has independent meetings
and an independent structure.  Membership is free and open to
anyone.  TLUG is non-profit, non-political, and independent of
any educational or business organization.   TLUG is a loose,
100 percent volunteer organization.  Volunteers are
always welcome...&nbsp;&nbsp;   hint, hint, hint. &nbsp;&nbsp;   ;-)

After the meeting around 20 people went to Tengu for beer and
food.  We went to an alternate Tengu that was a little further from
the station.
