## Notes on the TLUG January 14 Nomikai
### C. Oda
#### January 16, 1998

#### 1.  Bigger and Better

I was running late to the January 14th nomikai.  I thought we were
  gathering at 19:30 at Tokyo station and the correct time was 19:15.
  Everyone gathered 15 minutes before I got there and left.  Of course,
  when <B>Stephen Turnbull</B> and <B>Rob Bickel</B> asked me what time the meeting
  was, I said 19:30 at Tokyo station.  We moved from Yaesu bookstore to
  Tokyo station just in time to meet <B>Yohko Kase</B> and <B>Ayako Kato</B>
  . While
  this was a pleasant experience for the three men, the two ladies were
  saying, "where is all the membership?"  Where was everyone?  We went
  up to Tengu, hoping that we would bump into a few members, and were
  surprised when we met about 20 loud TLUGers drinking beer and already
  chowing down on food. <B>Daniel Kenny</B>, the organizer of this successful
  event was running around trying to make sure everyone had a chair and
  a beer.

 We had space for about 15 people and we just squashed 25 people in
  there.  It was great. Beer moved to Japanese sake, atsukan.	The
  chicken, pizza, beef, and sushi were great.

  There was a big showing of Japanese members from IMASY, a non-profit
  Yokohama ISP. This was due to the efforts of TLUGer <B>Ken Harada</B>.

#### 2.  Read About the Excitement, See the Action Pictures

<B>Ken</B>, dedicated TLUGer that he is, was the first to post meeting notes.
  This is a tremendous effort considering that he must have been hung
  over.

[Japanese Description](/meetings-notes/1998/01/description-j/)

<B>Yuusuke Tamula</B> went all out and has produced a wonderful page with 21
full-color full-size pictures of the evening <CITE>(Some of which appear on this page as well)</CITE>. <B>Tamula-san</B> also wrote
an exciting narrative of the evening.

I was even more impressed with the work when I found out that he
  missed the last train home and probably produced the page with frozen
  hands.

<B>John Little</B> ran around with a pen and paper and got a listing of the

#### 3.  The Second Bar - Beer part II

Well, about 10:30 p.m. we started to worry about making it home okay
  so we pried our fingers from the beer mugs and walked outside Tengu.
  However, people started shouting nijikai.  So, we ended up at
  Kitanokazoku. The nijikai was quieter and we got to talk more in
  depth about the technology that drew us together.  I left after they
  took the last order and there were still people there, so I can't
  explain what happened.  I hope they didn't install another server in
  the bar in their drunken state.

####  4.  Any Official Club Stuff?

<B>Joe Marchak</B> brought the TLUG library and we loaned out some software
  to spread the power of Linux among the people of Tokyo.

<B>Masanori-san</B> collected 4,429 yen for the club.  This brings the total
  to 24,590 yen.  We may get enough money to actually hire an artist to
  design our T-Shirt.  Or, we may be able to have a contest for the T-
  Shirt design and give out prize money.

Twenty-five people attended the January Nomikai.  The group continues
to grow and we continue to seek ways to integrate more Japanese people
and more women into our Linux community.

The next meeting is at Joe's office, HSBC, on February 14th.
