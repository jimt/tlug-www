<P>  
Thanks to everyone for coming out and supporting Linux at the 
October 10th meeting!   We had a good turnout to help set up starting 
at 10:00, and over 50 people came to the meeting overall.  The 
nijikai was another success as well - it was fun to see PC's and
monitors from the auction lining the walls of Tengu :-) </P>

<P>Thanks to Shigeo Honda for this <A HREF="photo_5.html">
slide show of the meeting</A>, Ken Harada for 
<A HREF="http://www.hayama.net/~kenhrd/snaps/19981010tlug/index.shtml">

 <LI TYPE=circle>  IPv6 at IMASY by <B>Ichiro Fukuhara</B> and <B>Hajimu Umemoto</B>
    <P>
    An in-depth look at how IPv6 testing is progressing at leading
    Japanese organizations in co-ordination with IMASY.  Although
    most of their work is being done with FreeBSD, they are working
    towards including more Linux interfacing.  One thing this talk
    really showed was that there is a lot of commonality between
    the FreeBSD group and Linux groups, and a lot of opportunity to
    work together. 
    <P>
    The development of the IPv6 protocol and its experiments are joint and global effort,
    where Open Software community play a great role. IMASY has been working with
    WIDE - 6 bone project to the actual experimentation of IPv6 through V6-V4-V6
    tunneling. IMASY plans to the first Japanese ISP who OFFICIALLY supports IPv6
    protocol for dialup subscribers.

    <P>
    IMASY, Internet Mutual Aid Society is a Yokohama based regional, non-profit Internet
    Service Provider and network users community. <A HREF="http://www.imasy.or.jp">
    (http://www.imasy.or.jp)</A>. All the technical support and operations 
    are performed though the enthusiasts' efforts. 
    <P>
    <B>Ichiro Fukuhara</B> is the Chief Engineer of IMASY and responsible for the system
    design, hardware and software selection, and day to day operations.
    <P>
    <B>Hajimu Umemoto</B> is an Engineer of IMASY who is in charge of the 
    same roles. 
    <P>
 <LI TYPE=circle>  Corel Netwinder Computer by <B>Jim Tittsler</B>
    <P> 
    This is one tight package!  A 275MHz screamer built into the size
    of a small router, the Corel Netwinder is a neat system to play
    with, and could offer commercial customers a solution for small
    spaces.
    <P>
    He used MagicPoint <A HREF="http://www.mew.org/mgp/">http://www.mew.org/mgp/</A>
     to show an outline.
    <P>
    He has also left a copy of the presentation (without the audio clip :-) at:
    <A HREF="ftp://starship.skyport.net/pub/crew/jtittsler/tlug-netwinder.tgz">
    ftp://starship.skyport.net/pub/crew/jtittsler/tlug-netwinder.tgz</A>
    The netwinder.mgp file is plain text if you just want to look through
    the outline.
    <P>

    <P>
    <LI TYPE=circle>  VNC by <B>Urs Roesch</B>
    <P>
    VNC lets you have an Xwindow of one computer running Linux, MS,
    or Solaris on another box.  This is a really good way of having
    MS apps ready to use on your Linux box without having to switch
    monitors.
    <P>

    <P>

    <P> 
    <B>Rex Walters</B> has volunteered to co-ordinate the Tlug CDROM circle
    to produce CD's for the group.  If you are interested in helping out
    by burning CD's or collecting useful programs, please get in contact
    with Rex <A HREF="mailto:rex@auspex.co.jp">(rex@auspex.co.jp)</A>.   At present, we have:
    <P>

    meeting.  
    <P>
    <LI TYPE=circle>Auction:
    <P>
    This month's auction proved to be the most successful yet!  The
    totals aren't in yet, but it looks like the proceeds will be
    the highest so far.   Thanks to <B>Jim Tittsler</B> for being our 
    auctioneer!
    <P>
    <LI TYPE=circle>Elections:
    <P>
    We had two volunteers to join the Tlug executive as technical
    directors, <B>Rex Walters</B> and <B>Kenichi Itsumi</B>, who were elected by
    acclamation.  Thanks for volunteering!  
    <P>
