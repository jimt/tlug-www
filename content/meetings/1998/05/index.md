We got into a deep philosophical discussion around 3:00 a.m.  This
was partly due to us finding Ken Schwarz's liquor cabinet and 
making friends with a bottle of malt whiskey.

I stumbled out of the party at 5:00 a.m. on Saturday morning.  Wow,
intense fun, good friends, and excellent conversation.  An awesome
TLUG event.
