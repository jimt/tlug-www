<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>The TLUG Bonenkai is a great chance to catch up with TLUG friends and meet the community.　The event is open to all Linux users and friends, as well as those who would like to hang out with Linux people.</p>
<p>If you have a strong preference for drinking out of a regular sized beer glass please bring your own as the kitchen only has the small Japanese style toast glasses.</p>
<p><em>If you are planning on attending please reply to the announcement email on the mailing list and make payment promptly as we need funds to organise food and drinks.</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
