<h6 id="honeypots_and_other_open_source_security_tools_from_the_honeynet_project_by_benny_ketelslegers">“Honeypots and other open-source security tools from the Honeynet Project” by <font color="#CC2200">Benny Ketelslegers</font></h6>
<p>The Honeynet Project is a leading international security research
organization, dedicated to investigating the latest attacks, developing
open source security tools to improve Internet security and learning how
malicious hackers behave.
In this presentation, we will learn what kind of honeypots there are, how
they are used and the insights they give into network/system attacks.
Secondly, a run-through will be given of the (open-source) tools provided
by the project and how to use them.</p>
<h6 id="wakame_vdc_by_andreas_kieckens">“Wakame-vdc” by <font color="#CC2200">Andreas Kieckens</font></h6>
<p>Wakame-vdc is an open source IaaS system written in Ruby that runs on
Ubuntu and OpenSolaris. During this presentation he will briefly explain
what an IaaS system is and what advantages it has over a standard data
centre. He will then cover several of Wakame's features and explain some
of the bleeding edge software it uses. (such as virtualizing the network
itself using OpenFlow.) If there's an internet connection available,
there will also be a live demo.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
