<p>
Edmund Edgar will give a talk about re-mastering Knoppix / Morphix to
make customized live-CDs.
</p>
<p>
By hacking live-CDs like Knoppix and Morphix, you can make your own
GNU/Linux distribution that boots directly from a CD,  without the
need for an install.
</p>
<p>
He'll give a basic outline of what the live-cds do and how they perform
their magic. Then He'll take a look at what you  have to do to twist
them to your own evil ends.
</p>
<p>
Alain Hoang will discuss teaching computer skills to children using
Squeak.
</p>
<p>
Squeak is a free SmallTalk-80 implementation that has been the basis
for a wide variety of software projects.  One such project is the
eToys system, which has been dubbed a 'media authoring tool.'   This
talk will be a recounting of my personal experiences teaching the
eToys system in Squeak to a small set of children and some of the
pitfalls He has run into and experiences learned.
