Good evening TLUGers,

    Thanks to all that made it to my presentation in beautiful, sunny Tokyo. :-)

This email is for those who had more interest in Squeak and wanted
some useful links that I didn't put down at all in my presentation
(sorry about that).

Just for note, although these websites are very good resources a lot
of the active action for Squeak tends to happen on the mailing lists.
The ones I tend to follow are the Squeak Developers Mailing List (VERY
high traffic), the Squeak VM Developers, the Squeak-ja (Japanese)
mailing list, and the Open Croquet mailing lists.  I believe you
should be able to find info on the mailing lists from the links below.

Here is a select list of links I think would be interesting to
TLUGers with some brief explanations of each:
------------------------
http://www.squeakland.org   ->  The main eToys resource.   You can download the
                                Squeakland branch of Squeak which is aimed for children.
                                This should also install a Squeak Plugin for your browser so
                                you can publish Squeak projects on the web and be able to
                                view them from a browser.

http://www.squeakland.jp       ->  The Japanese version of above

http://squeak.hp.infoseek.co.jp/nihongo.htm    ->    A website for the Japanese version of Squeak.
                                                     I've not fully researched the differences between
                                                     the squeakland.jp and this version.  But the
                                                     this is where the Japanese version first came up.

http://www.small-land.org      ->   This is the Spanish branch of Squeakland.  I think eventually
                                    this will fold into the Squeakland eventually but it has slightly
                                    different goals than the Squeakland folk.

http://www.squeak.org            ->   The main web site for people who want to hack on Squeak.

http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/squeak     ->  A very large collection of information on Squeak.
                                           A little cluttered and not all the information matches
                                           what is happening but a very large and useful resource.

http://www.edu.soc.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/c5-05/       ->   Conference on Creating, Connecting, and Collaborating
                                                     through Computing.  Lots of Squeakers will show be here.
                                                     It's at the end of this month.  If anyone is going hopefully I'll
                                                     see you there

http://www.edu.city.kyoto.jp/school/alankay/    ->  The ALAN-K project in Kyoto

http://hw001.gate01.com/~thoru/squeak/funsqueak.html  -> Fun Fun Fun Squeak. A great resource on learning
                                                         eToys in japanese.
