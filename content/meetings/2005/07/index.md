    Edward Middleton will give two mini talks:
    </p>
    <p>
    The kuro box mini-presentation will give an introduction to the
    hardware and look at the differences with a conventional GNU/Linux PC.
    We will then go through the installation steps for Gentoo linux. 
    <p>
    The greasemonkey mini-presentation will give a basic introduction to
    greasemonkey looking at the problem it is intended to solve.  We will
    then give a practical example of its use to modify a web page.  In the
    presentation we will cover the use of Platypus, the DOM viewer, the
    source viewer and the JavaScript debugger.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="BigFirst">
    Zev Blut will give a talk about Phidgets.  Phidgets, which stands for
    physical widgets, are a collection of various sensors and servos that
    are designed for easy integration with computers.  Phidgets make it
    easy for people with a little knowledge of programming and nearly no
    knowledge in electrical engineering to make all types of interesting
    physical devices that can interact with you beyond the realm of just
    your keyboard and monitor.
