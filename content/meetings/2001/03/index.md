<h3 id="inside_an_electronic_dictionary">Inside an Electronic Dictionary</h3>
<p>This months topic will be presented by <font color="#CC2200">Jim Breen</font> Visiting
Professor, at the Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures
of Asia and Africa, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, Japan.</p>
<p>As Jim says.....</p>
<p>In the talk I intend to cover three aspects of what I have been doing
with electronic dictionaries and dictionary files over the last few
years:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the file(s) are structured, and why</li>
<li>how they are indexed and searched. The good bits and the limitations.</li>
<li>some of the implementation issues, as the files and techniques have been used on various platforms, both as stand-alone systems and servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone is left awake, I'll mention where I'm going with the XML
formatted files, and some plans for expanding the WWW server, and
finally doing a cross-platform standalone version.</p>
