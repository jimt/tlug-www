Subject: roxen talk link summary

hi,

since i can not put the slides from my talk online yet,
below is a summary of links:


i'd like to thank you all for a wonderfull afternoon and evening.
i enjoyed the time in tokyo very much, and i must say,
it's a city i could live in.

i am currently in ena, and there are a bunch more places on my list to visit.
though i hope to be able to come back to tokyo for a few days towards the end
of october, because i need to visit the chinese embassy to arrange a visa,
since i want to go there in november.

if any one of you could spare a little corner for me, please tell me.
you can ask jack about my qualities as a guest ;-)

i am always interrested in meeting new people anywhere in japan,
so if you know anyone else who would like to meet an austrian...
