<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>This event is open to all Linux users and friends, and is to promote casual Linux (and non-Linux) related discussions over a few cold ones. Even if you're not a Linux user or a LUG member, but want to hang out with Linux people, please come.</p>
<p>Even if you want to come at the last minute it's okay - we may have to squeeze a bit, but please come!</p>
