    presenter: "Yimin Gu"
    description: "FPGAs are powerful devices, but the mindset different from software development and the blackbox-like toolchains (and also ) makes it hard to start on. Yimin Gu will introduce the status of the newly emerged open-source FPGA toolchains. Some boards will be shown on-site."

    title: "How efficient are architectures x86/aarch/RISC-V etc. for a workload?"
    presenter: "Christian Horn"
    description: "Let's benchmark a cpu-bound workload over systems of various architectures, while measuring power consumption. Who will be most energy efficient? Christian will introduce the test setup, talk a bit about the used software. Then details on the benchmarked workload (“bzcat”), on the various systems he benchmarked, and then introduce and discuss the results."

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
