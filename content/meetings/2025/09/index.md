## Cost

We have selected the 3000 JPY course. Drinks are charged separately but
come at a 10% discount. The check will be divided evenly at the end, so
the cost per person will be ((3000 JPY * 10 reservations) + (0.9 * total
cost of drinks ordered)) / (number of people who show up).

## About This Nomikai

Join us for our September nomikai - a relaxed social gathering where TLUG members and friends can enjoy good food, drinks, and conversation in a casual setting. This is the perfect opportunity to:

- Meet other Linux enthusiasts in Tokyo
- Share experiences and stories from the tech world
- Discuss the latest developments in Linux and open source

- Simply relax and enjoy good company

Whether you're a long-time TLUG member or completely new to the group, you're warmly welcomed! Our nomikai events are designed to be inclusive and friendly, providing a comfortable environment for people of all backgrounds and experience levels.

## What to Expect

- **Casual atmosphere**: No presentations or formal agenda - just good conversation
- **Mixed languages**: Discussions happen in both English and Japanese
- **Varied backgrounds**: Meet developers, sysadmins, students, and tech enthusiasts
- **Flexible timing**: Join when you can, leave when you need to

## Cost

Costs are typically shared equally among attendees, usually ranging from 3,000-4,000 yen per person depending on the venue and what we order. We'll provide a cost estimate once the venue is confirmed.
