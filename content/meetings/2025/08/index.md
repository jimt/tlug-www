## Background {#introduction}

All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in
the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux
Users Group meeting. **Membership is open to anyone**. There are
currently **no membership dues** or entrance fees.

TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most
of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and
having informal discussions.

As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of
odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd
Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this
rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here
for date/venue changes as the date approaches.
