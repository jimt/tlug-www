<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>
    All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in
    the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux
    Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are
    currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.
</p>
<p>
    TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most
    of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and
    having informal discussions.
</p>
<p>
    As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of
    odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd
    Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this
    rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here
    for date/venue changes as the date approaches.
