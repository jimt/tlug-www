<h5 id="presentations">Presentations</h5>
<h6 id="version_control_done_right_by_andreas_kieckens">“Version Control Done Right” by <font color="#CC2200">Andreas Kieckens</font></h6>
<p>A brief explanation of what Version control is and why
Andreas uses GIT and not another one. Then he'll describe
a successful GIT branching system in detail and explain
why you should use it.</p>
<h6 id="debian_on_the_desktop_a_guide_for_ubuntu_refugees_by_travis_cardwell">“Debian on the Desktop: A Guide for Ubuntu Refugees” by <font color="#CC2200">Travis Cardwell</font></h6>
<p>Many desktop environments these days offer premature mobile-
oriented user interfaces, gluttonous resource utilization, and over-
minimization. This talk gives tips for overcoming these issues by setting
up a modern desktop on Debian 7. Topics to be covered include the testing
distribution, backports, multiarch, third-party software installation, and
alternative window managers.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
