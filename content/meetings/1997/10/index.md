<p>from <a href="http://www.tlug.jp/meetings/9710/oct-97.html">1</a> <em>Saturday, October, 1997</em></p>
<p>The October, 1997 meeting of the Tokyo Linux Users Group (TLUG) brought together a lot of enthusiasts and a lot of equipment. Altogether, 18 people showed up.</p>
<p>Prior to the meeting, Alberto Tomita, Joe Marchak, and Demian Martos prepared the LAN and workstations at the HSBC office. About the same time, a dozen TLUGers were chowing curry then meeting up with three new members at Starbucks.</p>

<p>There was a short comparison of Wnn and Canna Japanese conversion engines. Wnn is older and Hajime Saito mentioned that it might have a better dictionary. Wnn is no longer under development as free software. Wnn6 is commercial software available from Omron. Canna is still under active development. There was also a discussion comparing Slackware, RedHate and Debian installations.</p>
<h2 id="sparc_linux">Sparc Linux</h2>
<p>John Little and Jim Tittsler gave an introduction to Sparc Linux. The installation could have gone better.</p>
<p>“No, it still hasn't finished making the file systems.” We spent an embarassingly long time trying to make Ext2 filesystems on the 2GB hard disk connected to a SparcStation1+ with 16MB of RAM. After cheating and only making a few moderate-sized partitions, we were eventually able to get Linux for Sparc installed.</p>
<p>There was a lot of variety at the meeting, ranging from the smallest Linux notebook yet to be seen at a TLUG meeting to the impressive Linux library Joe is building at HSBC.</p>
<p>People at the meeting discussed Japanese on Linux, Sparc Linux, and took care of some administrivia. Craig Oda was elected to a 1 year term as President of TLUG and several goals were set for the coming months - get a dedicated TLUG machine with a full-time connection, provide greater support of multilingual software design and increase the number of meetings.
