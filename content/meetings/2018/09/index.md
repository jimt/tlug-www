<h5 id="itinerary">Itinerary</h5>
<p>1. Yamaha THR10 guitar amp Linux demo (30 minutes)</p>
<p>The THR10 is a small relatively affordable guitar amplifier for home use.
One nice feature is that if you plug it into Linux via USB, it gets
recognized as a sound card. This talk will include a very brief
explanation of the Linux sound architecture followed by a live demo
where we record a couple simple guitar tunes.</p>
<p>2. 10 minute lighting talks open to anybody.</p>
<p>Currently decided:</p>
<ul>
<li>The winning combination of 4k and tiling window managers.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="other_items_on_the_agenda">Other items on the agenda</h5>
<ol>
<li>Introduction of new members</li>
<li>News about Linux/Open Source, general announcements, Q&amp;A</li>
<li>Auction (bring any gear that would would like to donate to TLUG)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
