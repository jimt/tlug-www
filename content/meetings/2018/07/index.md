<p><strong>“Introduction to Snakemake” - by <font color="#CC2200">Raymond Wan</font></strong></p>
<p>Snakemake is a workflow definition language similar to
Make that is gradually becoming popular in the field of
bioinformatics. Even so, there is nothing about Snakemake that limits
its use to bioinformatics. Unlike Make, the Snakemake language is
Python-based. In this talk, I will introduce Snakemake and provide
examples of how it can be used for data analysis.</p>
<p><strong>“VDO, transparent Linux compression/de-duplication layer” by <font color="#CC2200">Christian Horn</font></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use cases: where can VDO help?</li>
<li>VDO setup and configuration</li>
<li>How is VDO influencing read/write performance?</li>
<li>How much storage space can I save for my use cases?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“Linux on the Nintendo Switch” - by <font color="#CC2200">Christian Horn</font></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why is Linux@nintendo-switch interesting at all, what is required to get it running?</li>
<li>What works, what works not, on various distros? What is the Linux installation looking like?</li>
<li>Demo (will be hard to show it nicely, as HDMI output is not working and the internal screen is small)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>“Introduction to Matrix, a platform for unified, decentralised, secure communication” - by <font color="#CC2200">Alexey Rusakov</font></strong></p>
<p>The talk will discuss Matrix (https://www.matrix.org), an open network
for real-time communications. I will describe its main features (servers
federation, end-to-end encryption, bridging) and show what sets Matrix
apart from many other messengers. I'll further talk about how one can
use Matrix to bridge communities across other networks, both proprietary
and open, including IRC, Telegram and Slack. An overview of the
ecosystem and a short demo will conclude the talk.</p>
<h4 id="after">After</h4>

serving at the stall for “<a href="https://www.weltenburger.de/sortiment/">Weltenburger</a>, the world's oldest abbey

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
