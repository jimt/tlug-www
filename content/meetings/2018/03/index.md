<p>Programming music with Sonic Pi by Andreas Kieckens</p>
<p><a href="http://sonic-pi.net">http://sonic-pi.net</a></p>
<p>Sonic Pi is a programming language based on Ruby that allows you to
effectively write music using code. Its author intended it to be
used both as a live instrument that you're able to gig with, as well
as a classroom utility to help students learn how to code in a fun
way. During this presentation Andreas will give a live demonstration
and also discuss some basics of music theory and how they can be
applied to programming.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
