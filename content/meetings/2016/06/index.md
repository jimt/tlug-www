<h6 id="visualising_trees_and_graphs_using_tcltk_and_graphviz_by_benjamin_kowarsch">Visualising Trees and Graphs using TCL/TK and GraphViz (by <font color="#CC2200">Benjamin Kowarsch</font>)</h6>
<p>This is a rather more practical presentation of tree and graph
visualisation in two parts:</p>
<p>(1) Rendering syntax diagrams using TCL/TK</p>
<p>In this part Benjamin will show how he generates and renders nice looking
syntax diagrams (aka railroad diagrams) with an open source TCL/TK script
and how you can modify the script for your own needs.</p>
<p>(2) Generating syntax trees and rendering them with GraphViz</p>
<p>In this part Benjamin will give a basic overview of the DOT graph language
used by the open source renderer GraphViz, then he will show how he builds
syntax trees from source code to generate DOT output using his own compiler
(written in C) and then render the output with GraphViz.</p>
<p>Attendees are invited to pre-install TCL/TK and GraphViz on their computers
for some practical experimentation after the presentation.</p>
<h6 id="fire_eye_services_and_technology_and_the_role_of_a_linux_admin_by_erin_hughes">Fire Eye Services and Technology and the role of a Linux Admin (by <font color="#CC2200">Erin Hughes </font>)</h6>
<p>A brief overview of Fire Eye(*) services and technology and how Linux
administration skills are the key to success in securing non-Linux
(e.g. Windows) environment.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
