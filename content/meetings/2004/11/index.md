Benjamin Kowarsch

<li>"Personal information management"</li>
</p>
<p>
Sacha Chua
</p>
</ol>
<p>
Benjamin Kowarsch will talk about the Wolverine project and how to use
the VPN and firewall functions it includes.  Depending upon how the
presentation goes this talk may segue into discussions about
opportunistic encryption and VPNs.
</p>
<p>
How do you keep track of the things you need to do? Post-it notes?
Text files? // TODO comments? Groupware?
</p>
<p>
Sacha Chua will share some ways of keeping track of tasks,
appointments and notes under Linux. She'll talk about advantages,
disadvantages, and implementation tips for alternatives to mainstream
PIMs such as Evolution and KOrganizer, from ~/TODO files all the way
up to wikis.
</p>
<p>
She is also looking forward to hearing people gripe about existing
PIMs or think of features they'd like to have, and hopes to steal
particularly cool ideas for the Emacs-based PIM she maintains.
</p>
<p>
Come and compare notes about how you keep track of things. Who knows,
you might find some of the ideas nifty.
</p>
