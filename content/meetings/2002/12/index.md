This event is open to all Linux users and friends, and is
to promote casual Linux (and non-Linux) related discussions
over a few cold ones. Even if you're not a Linux user or a
LUG member, but want to hang out with Linux people, please come.

Tengu is about 2 minutes walking from the Karasumori exit of the JR Shimbashi train station.

If you get lost, or simply want to get in touch with us, please
call:

Mauro : 090-2492-0840

See you there!
