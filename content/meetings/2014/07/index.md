<p>Most strongly typed, functional programming languages are not equipped with a reentrant garbage collector.
Therefore such languages are not used for operating systems programming, where the virtues of types are most desired.
We propose the use of Context-Local Heaps (CLHs) to achieve reentrancy, which also increasing the speed of garbage collection.
We have implemented CLHs in Ajhc <a href="http://ajhc.metasepi.org/">http://ajhc.metasepi.org/</a>, a Haskell compiler derived from jhc <a href="http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/">http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/</a>, rewritten some NetBSD sound drivers using Ajhc, and benchmarked them.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
