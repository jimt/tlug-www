<p>TuxGuitar is a tool that allows you to compose music and download other people's compositions.
It's focused mostly around guitar and is a great tool to learn the instrument.
Andreas will give a tour of the software and how he uses it to practice guitar playing
or write down music that he comes up with.</p>

<p>Tail call optimization is a feature of a programming language
(compiler or interpreter) that is essential for writing efficient
recursive functions. Travis will explain tail call optimization and then
show its (mis)use in various programming languages, including some that
do not support it.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
