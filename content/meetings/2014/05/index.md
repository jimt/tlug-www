<p>Ninja skillz for emergency Data Analytics or how to stay in command of when something hits the fan...</p>
<p>What do you do when, out of the blue, you sense emergency in the air,
but you have no exact idea what is coming, from where it is going to
hit you and since when it has been lurking? You get the data, all the
data you can, and analyze it to extract information. You may already
have the data, but in hard-to-digest form, spread among people,
servers and some backup tapes. Or you may not, so you have to go out
and collect it first. Then analyze it. But not in emergency! You have
to do all at once, with no sleep, some food and more caffeine,
completely out of control most of the time.
I help clients with security issues as may day (night?) job, digging
into all kinds of (legacy) systems, trying to understand what happened
(fancy named Digital Forensics), when and eventually who did it. I
have to deal with all kinds of data, stored in multitude of (first
seen this) formats/media, most of it _very_ badly formatted/(not)
cleansed or simply missing. Usually starting on a Friday night, when
most sysadmins had already had more than enough alcohol in their
bloodstream to be useful.</p>
<p>To cope with all I use the COMMAND LINE, hell I live on the command line!</p>
<p>I grep with fancy regex-es, cut and sort, while forking many finds and
shove data up pipes of all kind and visualize data in gnuplot. To glue
all that I use Bash and Perl and Vim.</p>
<p>After 3/11, LoL, I got involved with Safecast in another emergency -
understanding what happened in Fukushima Dai-ichi NPP. I used more or
less the same methods and since data is public, I'll use it in a demo
of CLI approaches to Data Analytics. We'll analyze and visualize some
of the data with some ninja tricks, stay alert!</p>
<h6 id="linux_quiz_by_travis_cardwell">Linux Quiz (by <font color="#CC2200">Travis Cardwell</font>)</h6>
<p>Would you like to explore and expand your knowledge of Linux?
The Linux Quiz will be an interactive discussion where people of all
experience levels, from beginners to seasoned sysadmins, can ask questions
and share their knowledge about all things Linux in a friendly,
non-competitive atmosphere.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
