<h6 id="introduction_to_functional_programming_hands_on_with_racket_by_travis_cardwell">Introduction to Functional Programming: Hands-On with Racket (by <font color="#CC2200">Travis Cardwell</font>)</h6>
<p>Travis will give an interactive class on the basics of
functional programming using <a href="http://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>, a dialect of
Scheme. Please install Racket (not Minimal Racket) onto a laptop and bring
it with you to the meeting!</p>
<h6 id="adventures_in_tail_call_optimization_by_travis_cardwell">Adventures in Tail Call Optimization (by <font color="#CC2200">Travis Cardwell</font>)</h6>
<p>Tail call optimization is a feature of a programming language
(compiler or interpreter) that is essential for writing efficient
recursive functions. Travis will explain tail call optimization and then
show its (mis)use in various programming languages, including some that
do not support it.</p>
<h6 id="discussion_presentation_wish_list">Discussion: Presentation Wish List</h6>
<p>What kind of topics would you like to see at a future TLUG
technical meeting? Travis will chair a discussion where we create a wish
list, which will later be posted to the mailing list so that any member
can pick a topic that they know about and share their knowledge at future
meetings.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
