<p>Ohta-san will present a report on the activities of the RPi community
in Japan that took place throughout 2013. He will also talk about his
plans to hold an event early in 2014, when Eben Upton is scheduled to
come to Japan.</p>
<h6 id="introduction_to_docker_by_travis_cardwell">Introduction to Docker (by <font color="#CC2200">Travis Cardwell</font>)</h6>
<p>Full virtualization has been around since the 1960s, but increased
hardware speeds allowed the technology to revolutionize commodity
server and workstation infrastructure in the mid-2000s. Similarly,
operating system-level virtualization has its roots in FreeBSD jails,
dating back to 1998, but the release of Docker in 2013 allows easy use
of Linux containers and is bringing about another revolution. In this
presentation, Travis will explain the technology behind Docker and
demonstrate its use. Change the way you use Linux!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
