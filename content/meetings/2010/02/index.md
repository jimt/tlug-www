<p>Fyodor's Nmap port scanner is an essential open-source tool for sysadmins, penetration testers and curious people. It is also one of the few pieces of software to have achieved cult status, being featured in movies as bad as The Matrix Reloaded and Die Hard 4.</p>
<p>This talk will begin with a brief overview of port scanning for those unfamiliar with the topic. The main uses of Nmap will then be discussed, as well as different types of scans, scan optimization, OS detection and defense against port scanning.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Background</h3>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or <b>entrance fees</b>.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd SAT of the month and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd FRI of even numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
