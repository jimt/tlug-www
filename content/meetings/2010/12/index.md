<p>To help us make sure that there will be room for everyone to seat, please register your attendance in <a href="http://tlug.doorkeeper.jp/">Doorkeeper</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you want to come at the last minute it's okay - we may have to squeeze a bit, but please come!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd SAT of the month and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 3rd FRI, every month. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
