<p><strong>“Cracking Japanese text apart with Mecab”</strong> By <em>Akira Kurogane</em></p>
<p>Mecab is a well-regarded natural language processing library for
Japanese text. Already it is an important tool for linguistic study
and no doubt is used in many search tools, but a third use has been
found- helping non-native readers learn nihongo as they read it (e.g.
on the web). Some methodology explained, and some demonstrations
given.</p>
<p><strong>Links related to the talk:</strong></p>
<p>Firefox add-on for easy demonstration of Mecab: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xpcom-mecab/">xpcom-mecab</a></p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/furigana-injector/">Furigana Injector</a>. (N.B. Please download from the development homepage link to the left. The last version released on the official Mozilla Add-ons site is an old one that does not apply Mecab.)</p>

<p>Package names for the compiled command-line programs are simply “mecab”, “mecab-devel”, etc.. The usual dictionary to use is IPADIC, i.e. package “mecab-ipadic”. (In some distributions the dictionary may be available in different charsets, e.g. mecab-ipadic-utf8. Use whichever you like.) There is also a MacPort (at least for older versions) and a Windows installer.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>TLUG meetings will be announced on this page. We are always looking for people who would like to give demonstrations. If you have any ideas about meeting events, please let us know.</p>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or <b>entrance fees</b>.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd SAT of odd numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd FRI of even numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
