<p><strong>dot-home for version-control of a users environment configuration</strong> - Curt Sampson</p>
<p>dot-home[1] lets you have version-controlled user environment
configuration easily distributed amongst many different machines, with
the ability to make changes anywhere and get them out to the other
machines. It also lets you partition your configuration so that
personal configuration doesn't end up on work machines and vice versa,
yet common configuration is shared.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
