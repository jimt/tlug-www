<p><em>Dimension reduction, and word embeddings, in Natural Language
Processing</em> - by Darren Cook</p>
<p>Darren will talk about dimension reduction, and word embeddings in
particular: the technology underlying a lot of the recent advances in
natural language processing. He will show the same example in both
English and Japanese, so you can get a good feel for what bits are
common between languages, and what still needs language-specific processing.</p>
<p>Darren Cook is a data scientist, and director at QQ Trend Ltd. He is
author of two O'Reilly books, one on low-latency streaming to the
browser, one on the H2O machine learning system. Currently based in the
U.K., after nearly 20 years in Japan. A TLUG member since forever, but
only gets to a meeting once every five years or so...</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
