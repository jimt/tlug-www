<p><em>Towards a “Humane Interface”: Back to the Future with the Canon Cat</em> - by Karamoon</p>
<p>Dr. Emmett Brown famously said “'Where we're going, we don't need roads’. We do, however, need user interfaces that are fit for purpose.</p>
<p>As computing becomes not just ubiquitous but pervasive, we’re continually guided, funnelled, distracted, misled, entrapped and even assaulted (visually and aurally) by applications, by their interfaces and by the operating systems upon which our applications run.</p>
<p>In place of the “calm technology” proposed by Mark D. Weiser of Xerox PARC we have a noisy, messy computing environment. It’s an environment that gets in the way of what we want to do, instead of augmenting our ability as humans to get things done.</p>
<p>Do things have to be this way? Does the distant past offer us a scrap of hope?</p>
<p>What happened to Weiser’s four principles of ubiquitous computing? Have they been lost in time, like tears down the drain?
1. The purpose of a computer is to help you do something else.
2. The best computer is a quiet, invisible servant.
3. The more you can do by intuition the smarter you are; the computer should extend your unconscious.
4. Technology should create calm.</p>
<p>It’s almost impossible to imagine different ways of doing things. Surely computing must be the way it is. And yet…</p>
<p>This talk will look at Jef Raskin's M68000-based "Canon Cat”.</p>
<p>It’s an unusual computer and interesting computer released in 1987. Perhaps it gives us a glimpse into a possible future of human-computer interaction?</p>
<p>The most striking feature of the Canon Cat its lack of any software application; instead it consists of a single document with all functionality provided at OS-level. There are some other interesting points too such as the embedded Forth compiler, an assembly language, a novel file system, incremental search...</p>
<p><strong>“Decentralised secure communication with Matrix - status update” - by <font color="#CC2200">Alexey Rusakov</font></strong></p>
<p>The talk will give a briefly overview Matrix (https://www.matrix.org), an open decentralised network for real-time communications and provide a status update on what has been happening with it over the last year.</p>
<p>It will cover advanced end-to-end encryption features, news on clients and bridges, general things about the ecosystem and future plans. Questions and extra requests are welcome: we can setup a homeserver, draft up yet-another-bot, or talk about details of the Matrix protocols.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Background</h2>
<p>All Linux lovers, and supporters of open source code and free software, in the Kanto area (or anywhere else) are invited to attend the next Tokyo Linux Users Group meeting. <b>Membership is open to anyone</b>. There are currently <b>no membership dues</b> or entrance fees.</p>
<p>TLUG meetings are traditionally small and unstructured (VERY CASUAL). Most of the benefit of the meeting comes from chatting with other Linux users and having informal discussions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the Technical Meetings are held on the 2nd Saturday of odd-numbered months and the Nomikai Meetings are usually held on the 2nd Friday of even-numbered months. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, so it is best to keep an eye on the mailing list, or check back here for date/venue changes as the date approaches.</p>
