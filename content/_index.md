## About TLUG

The Tokyo Linux Users Group grew out of the creative energies of some of Japan’s Internet pioneers. They recognized the significance of Linux and within months held the first official meeting in September of 1994.

On June 16, 1994 TLUG was born as the “LINUX” conference on TWICS, which was the only public access Internet Service Provider in Japan at that time. The atmosphere was exciting and friendly, and everyone began helping each other fix problems and learn about Linux. One of the early members commented, “It felt like we were all on the edge of this frontier and that together we were taming this networked, high-tech jungle. It was great!”

“It felt like we were all on the edge of this frontier and that together we were taming this networked, high-tech jungle.”
TLUG is a non-profit users group, whose members exchange information on the development and use of the Linux kernel and Free Software Foundation tools. Physical and online meetings are held in English and Japanese. All are welcome.
