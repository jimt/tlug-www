# Experimental TLUG Website

This is an experimental reimplementation of the TLUG website
using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the
[PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.

## Design

- implemented in Hugo (Go) so it can easily be rebuilt and deployed on Netlify on push
- editing a new meeting page automatically puts the upcoming meeting on the homepage
- fixes the missing "Past Meetings" link by creating a new Meetings page
- reinstates some missing image galleries from the 90s and 00s
- uses a more modern, mobile-friendly layout
- can be edited with Markdown (or HTML fragments) rather than wikitext
